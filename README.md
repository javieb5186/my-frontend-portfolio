## User Story and Acceptance Criteria

### User Story 

AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

### Acceptance Critera 

GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- I need a portfolio to showcase anybody who would like to hire me for their services.
- I built this project as a way to practice and apply my new CSS Knowledge. 
- Because this isn't an official portfolio, it definitly starts to make me think about my official portfolio and how to create / design it.
- I learned more about CSS grids than I did before and pretty much everything inside an html can be designed.

When I was trying to get/set a Style value with javascript, I didn't know you that there are two correct ways to access a CSS value. After reading, this now I
know a little about why accessing something might not work.

- 1024px+.

To confirm that everything is working. Resize different ratios to see the responsive layouts.
